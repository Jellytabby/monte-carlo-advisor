Next steps:
[✓] add median_runtime rather than one time run result
[✓] adding unrolling
    [✓] comparing to O3
        [✓] starting state for tree based on O3 
            [✓] check inline advisor for default options
        [✓] plots of the optimization stages
            [✓] rt of O3 vs rt of MC at each choice
[ ] pinning threads to a select core (OpenMP, idk ask ivan)
- bigger benchmark
    [ ] polybench
    - xsbench
    - lulesh
    - rodinia
- how many loops/function/how big program affects time to explore tree
    - program size vs tree size 
- add autotune attributes
    - existing passes to extract functions -> search for `llvm-extract` in llvm codebase
- independent loops based on features

Notes for theresa:
    annoying: 
        - your program freezing and having to hunt down which pipe swalloed the error explaining what happened :(
        - deadlocks :(



If you have all children -> UCT
If you don't -> random unvisited child -> leads to visiting all children



The max gets changed in the following ways:
    wanted:
        - the leaf node we just visited is the new max value, so we set max_node to it and take its score value
    unwanted:
        - max_node is a leaf, and we revisit it. the second run results in a lower score, so it overwrites the previous maximum score with a slightly lower score.
        - max_node is not a leaf, and we visit a child of it that has terrible performance -> drags down max_node's score.
